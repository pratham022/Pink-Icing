# Pink Icing: Sew In Style

## Inspiration:
* In Today's world, custom attire is more in demand as compared to ready made clothes. People tend to design their clothes for several occasions like weddings,house-warmings and other gatherings.
* Most presumably, ten years back, if you needed to consider getting your garments customized custom, you would have been unyielding about it costing you a bomb. 
* Introductions of Boutiques have given people the choice to customize their designs according to their needs and get their dresses ready with satisfying cost and desired look. However reaching out to the required Boutique can be quite difficult . 
* Thus having an online platform where we can have all the boutiques present at one place that can look at our required design and provide us with the best would ease our task as well as benefit the boutique owners.
* The Boutique owner will have a unique platform where they can post their designs and attract the customers and thus have better deals and make better business.

## What it does
* Customers can specify their requirements or post a hand made sketch of the designs that they want . 
* They can also post photos of dresses that they have seen online and wish to buy or stitch them.
* All the interested  boutiques can reach out to the customers and provide them with best deals that they can offer.
* They can maybe call or have a meeting or meet in person with the boutique head to know more about the design.
* The boutique owners can also post photos of their latest designs and attract  the customers.
* The boutique can also have several other products in their shop like jewellery set or weight gain or loss products or cosmetics they can also advertise through it.
* The website will have a messaging system for seamless communication between the customer and the boutique owner.
